Clade Classification 

The United States Government Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, owns the copyright to the accompanying software under FAR 52.227-14 (c). 

The Clade Classification repository repositoy contains codes for three classifications: Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Clade Classification, Global Swine H1 Clade Classification, and US Swine H1 Clade Classification

The Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Clade Classification contains the code to enable the algorithm for classifying the clade of the hemagglutinin gene of influenza A(H5) viruses. It uses phylogenetic analysis to classify HA (H5) sequences (from both highly pathogenic Goose/Guangdong-like viruses and from non-pathogenic Eurasian and American lineage viruses) according to the WHO classification scheme. It has been verified as highly accurate (> 98%) for sequences of at least 300 nucleotides of HA1. Refer to the 'IRD_H5_CLADE_SOP.pdf' for more details.

The Global Swine H1 Clade Classification: An algorithm that classify the clade of the HA of H1 viruses, from any host and any NA subtype, with reference to a global swine H1 reference tree. Refer to the 'SOP_Global_Swine_H1_Clade.pdf' for more details.

The US Swine H1 Clade Classification: An algorithm that classify the clade of the HA of H1 viruses, from any host and any NA subtype, with reference to the USDA classification of US swine H1 viruses.  Refer to the 'SOP_SwineH1CladeClassn_062415.pdf' for more details.
